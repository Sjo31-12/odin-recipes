        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This blueberry orange bread is bursting with orange essence and a pop of sweetness from blueberries, a perfect flavor combination.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup freshly-squeezed orange juice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup melted unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>grated rind of 1 fresh orange</li>
                <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
                <li>1/2 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons orange marmalade</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Add 1 1/2 cups flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl, and stir until well combined.</li>
                <li>Whisk orange juice, butter, eggs, and orange rind in a small bowl. Pour into the flour mixture, and stir until just combined.</li>
                <li>Place blueberries in a small bowl, sprinkle lightly with the 1/2 tablespoon flour until coated. Gently fold the blueberries into the batter, and spoon into the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Warm marmalade in the microwave for about 10 seconds to loosen and spread on top of the batter.</li>
                <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Allow bread to cool for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
